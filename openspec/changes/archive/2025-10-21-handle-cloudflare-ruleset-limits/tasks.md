## 1. Analysis
- [x] 1.1 Research Cloudflare ruleset limits and constraints
- [x] 1.2 Analyze current sync script to understand how rulesets are created
- [x] 1.3 Identify consolidation strategies (e.g., combining rules, using wildcards)

## 2. Implementation
- [x] 2.1 Modify sync-redirects.js to detect ruleset limits
- [x] 2.2 Implement ruleset consolidation logic
- [x] 2.3 Add error handling for limit exceeded scenarios
- [x] 2.4 Update validation script to check for potential limit issues

## 3. Testing
- [x] 3.1 Test consolidation logic with mock data
- [x] 3.2 Test sync with simulated limit conditions
- [x] 3.3 Validate that existing redirects still work after consolidation

## 4. Documentation
- [x] 4.1 Update README with information about ruleset limits
- [x] 4.2 Document consolidation behavior in code comments
